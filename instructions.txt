I have a CSV file called `data.csv` that contains health records for 10 patients. Each row includes demographic and health data, and whether the patient eventually developed diabetes.

Columns:
- PatientID: Unique identifier
- Age: Age in years
- Gender: M or F
- BMI: Body Mass Index
- SystolicBP: Systolic Blood Pressure
- DiastolicBP: Diastolic Blood Pressure
- Smoker: Yes/No
- PhysicalActivityLevel: Low/Moderate/High
- CholesterolLevel: Normal/Borderline/High
- FamilyHistory: Yes/No (if diabetes is in family)
- DevelopedDiabetes: Yes/No (target column)

**Goal**: Build a full predictive model that predicts whether a patient will develop diabetes (`DevelopedDiabetes`) based on the other features.

**Instructions**:
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Handle categorical variables (e.g., Gender, Smoker, etc.)
3. Convert `DevelopedDiabetes` to binary (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
4. Split the data into training and test sets (e.g., 80/20)
5. Train a logistic regression model (or another model if better suited)
6. Evaluate the model using accuracy and confusion matrix
7. Make predictions on test data and print results
8. Plot feature importance or coefficients
9. Save the model as a `.pkl` file

Please write complete working code using Python, pandas, and scikit-learn.


Then create a simple Streamlit app that:
- Loads the trained model from the `.pkl` file
- Provides a form for the user to input new patient data: Age, Gender, BMI, SystolicBP, DiastolicBP, Smoker, PhysicalActivityLevel, CholesterolLevel, FamilyHistory
- Uses the model to predict if the patient will develop diabetes
- Displays the result clearly on the screen
